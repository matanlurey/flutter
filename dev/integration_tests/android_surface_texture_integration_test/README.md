# android_surface_texture_integration_test

A Flutter project for testing external texture rendering on Android.

## Contributing

Unfortunately [`flutter_driver` is considered deprecated][1] and
[no documentation exists](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/142021), so
just do your best.

```shell
# Assuming you are in the root of the flutter repo.
